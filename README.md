# ⚛️ React-Then: Unfinished Business

This repository documents my journey of learning React from the ground up.  
I had previously learned React through one-shot tutorials and could build 🌐 dynamic, 🎨 animated, and 📱 responsive websites — but I skipped over some core concepts.  
Now, I’m revisiting React step by step to strengthen my fundamentals, fill in the gaps, and gain a deeper understanding.
